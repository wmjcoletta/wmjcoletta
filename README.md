- 👋 Hi, I’m @wmjcoletta
- 👀 I’m designing a 3-D videogame (which I call "Minding the Reef") for evolving, in autonomous avatars (competitively and cooperatively within the ecology of a simulcrum of a coral reef), what I call EI (Evolutionary Intelligence).  Irony, for example, is always already a part of even the activities of viruses, bacteria, and plants and animals (thus EI); however, getting irony is still a major problem for AI.  In gamifying EI interations, I hope to discover how to evolve intelligence in, again, autonomous avatars.
- 💞️ I am a Ph.D., a professor emeritus, a CEO and Founder of INT3RP INC (www.int3rpinc.com), and an expert in cognitive semiotics and biosemiotics (See my recent book
     "Biosemiotic Literary Criticism [2021], Springer Nature). I am an expert in analyzing intelligence from the POV of semiotics, specifically, the evolution of language and mind through an analysis of biological irony (biological mimicry) and the solving of complex visual puzzles (visual syntax) by predators caught up in (pun intended) predator-prey relationships.  See my article "Predation as Predication" in the journal "Semiotica."  Though I have studied computer coding, I am a humanities and environmental studies professor in search of top-notch coders interested in writing algorithms based on Peirce's 28 sign types and what I call BIA, the Biology of Ironic Arithmetic, as part of my EI-AI-O, Farming Intelligence, initiative.
