- 👋 Hi, I’m @wmjcoletta
- 👀 I’m interested in designing a 3-D videogame (which I call "Minding the Reef") for evolving in autonomous avatars (competitively and cooperatively) what I call (not AI but)
-     EI (Evolutionary Intelligence).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code ...
- 💞️ I am a Ph.D., a professor emeritus, a CEO and Founder of INT3RP INC (www.int3rpinc.com), and an expert in cognitive semiotics and biosemiotics (See my recent book
     "Biosemiotic Literary Criticism [2021], Springer Nature). I’m looking for coders to help me design, as part of my EI-AI-O, Farming Intelligence initiative, a videogame
     entitled "Minding the Reef." (See attachments / documents in my Repository)
