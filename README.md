- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @wmjcoletta
- üëÄ I‚Äôm designing a 3-D videogame (which I call "Minding the Reef") for evolving, in autonomous avatars (competitively and cooperatively within the ecology of a simulcrum of a coral reef), what I call EI (Evolutionary Intelligence).  In the natural world, irony, which is a difficult modality today for even advanced AI, is always already, right from the very beginning, a part of evolutiinary intelligence (EI), of the activities of even viruses, bacteria, and plant and animals.  For example, the strategy empoyed by the Greeks with their gift of the Trojan Horse in Homer's "The Illiad" is old news, having been for a billion years a part of the ironic ecology of entities in the natural world--think not only of how viruses trick their way past our immune systems but think also of the vast array of techniques involving biological mimicry in predator-prey relationships. In gamifying EI interations through virtual predator-prey and symbiotc relationships in "Minding the Reef," we will be able to guide autonomous avatars along the path leading to intelligence.
- üíûÔ∏è I am a Ph.D., a professor emeritus, a CEO and Founder of INT3RP INC (www.int3rpinc.com), and an expert in cognitive semiotics and biosemiotics (See my recent book
     "Biosemiotic Literary Criticism" [2021], Springer Nature). I am an expert in analyzing intelligence from the POV of semiotics, specifically, the evolution of language and mind through an analysis of biological irony (biological mimicry) and the solving of complex visual puzzles (visual syntax) by predators caught up in (pun intended) predator-prey relationships.  See my article "Predation as Predication" in the journal "Semiotica."  Though I have studied computer coding, I am a humanities and environmental studies professor in search of top-notch coders interested in writing algorithms based on Peirce's 28 sign types and what I call BIA, the Biology of Ironic Arithmetic, as part of my EI-AI-O, Farming Intelligence, initiative.
